    <h2>Pizza</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base
      of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often
      various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies,
      mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then
      baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="links1">10g fresh yeast or 7g sachet dried</li>
      <li class="links1">½ tsp sugar</li>
      <li class="links1">375g Italian '00' flour , plus extra for dusting</li>
      <li class="links1">1 tbsp olive oil , plus extra for greasing</li>
      <li class="links1">3 x 125g balls mozzarella , torn</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li class="links1">
        Mix together the yeast and sugar with 250ml warm water and leave to sit
        for 10 mins. Place half the flour in a table-top mixer with a dough
        hook, pour in the yeast mixture and beat at medium speed for 10 mins (or
        mix in a bowl, then knead with oiled hands in the bowl for 5-10 mins).
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        Leave somewhere warm for 10 more mins, then add the remaining flour and
        oil. Beat or knead to a dough for a further 5 mins. Put in a well-oiled
        bowl, cover with a cloth and place somewhere warm to double in size –
        about 1½ hrs.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        For the sauce, heat the oil in a pan over a moderate heat. Add the onion
        and cook for 3 mins, stirring constantly. Add the garlic, 1 tsp sea salt
        and 1 tsp ground black pepper and cook for 2 mins more. Add the tomatoes
        and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for a good 20
        mins, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        Once your dough has doubled in size, slap it down on a lightly floured
        surface and knead for 4 mins until soft but not too elastic. Divide into
        6 pieces, roll into balls and leave to rest for 10 mins. Heat oven to
        the highest temperature possible (270C fan in the Good Food test
        kitchen) and place a flat baking sheet in the oven.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        With a well-floured rolling pin, roll out each ball of dough as thinly
        as possible. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, oil or dust with
        flour, then carefully transfer the dough base onto it. Spread over some
        of the tomato sauce (I like to apply it in the quantity that you would
        spread Marmite on toast, or the base will be soft and fall to bits),
        then the cheese and any toppings you desire.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        Cook for between 5-10 mins depending on your oven temp, until the base
        is crisp and the cheese melted. Scatter with basil.
      </li>
