    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      A cookie is a baked or cooked snack or dessert that is typically small,
      flat and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar, egg, and some type of
      oil, fat, or butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins,
      oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="links1">Flour</li>
      <li class="links1">Starch</li>
      <li class="links1">Cream Butter</li>
      <li class="links1">Sugars</li>
      <li class="links1">Egg Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li class="links1">
        Sift dry ingredients like flour, leaveners (baking powder or baking
        soda) and cocoa powder (but not sugar) to combine and aerate them,
        making for fluffier cookies. Put them in a fine-mesh strainer over a
        piece of parchment paper, shake the strainer until everything's on the
        paper, then when it's time to add, pick up the paper and let the
        ingredients slide out into the mixing bowl. If sifting is not called
        for, whisk the dry ingredients for 30 seconds to combine.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        Cream the butter and sugar together. This creates air pockets that
        expand in the oven, making the dough tender. Butter beats up fluffiest
        at room temperature — it should hold a fingerprint with some resistance.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        Beat eggs into the creamed butter and sugar, one at a time, to add
        moisture to the air pockets and flavor to the dough. They’ll incorporate
        best at room temperature; place them in a bowl of warm water for a few
        minutes to warm them up quickly. Now is also the time to add the vanilla
        extract or sometimes milk, if the recipe calls for it.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        Add the dry ingredients in a few batches, folding gently. Scrape down
        the sides of the bowl as you go to keep everything incorporating evenly.
        Use a light touch — overworking the flour makes for tough results.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        Fold the heavy ingredients, like chocolate and nuts, into the batter to
        keep it light and tender. Sprinkle the mix-ins on top, then take a large
        flexible spatula and slice it into the center of the batter. Draw the
        spatula through the batter, folding the batter from the bottom of the
        bowl over the top. Keep going just until everything is incorporated.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        Each cookie recipe has its own shaping instructions. Drop cookies are
        simplest: Scoop dough with a spoon or a small ice-cream scoop and space
        the dough evenly on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Other shaping
        techniques include making a chilled log of dough and slicing it, rolling
        and cutting, and piping or using a cookie press.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        Bake for the shortest time suggested in the recipe, then check one
        cookie from the middle of the baking sheet and one from the edge for
        doneness. Rotate the baking sheets to help cookies cook evenly.
        Remember, the cookies will keep cooking once removed from the oven. Let
        them cool completely on a rack before decorating, and store them in an
        airtight container.
