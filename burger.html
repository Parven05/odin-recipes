    <h2>Burger</h2>
    <p>
      A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a
      patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread
      roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
      pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard,
      mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand
      Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A
      hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="links1">Meat</li>
      <li class="links1">Vegetable</li>
      <li class="links1">Bun</li>
      <li class="links1">Cheese</li>
      <li class="links1">Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="container2">
      <li class="links1">
        Dump your ground meat into a bowl. (We go for ground meat with around
        20% fat.) Season it with salt, pepper, and whatever else you want; you
        can add spices, perhaps, or Worcestershire sauce, or shallots, or
        chiles.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        Shape your burgers into patties, using your thumb to make an indentation
        in the center; this will keep the burgers from puffing up. Keep in mind
        that the burgers will shrink up a bit once you cook them, so make your
        patties a bit bigger than you want them later.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        Oil your grill or a cast-iron pan, and grill or sear those patties. (How
        many times to flip them is up for debate -- but when I'm grilling, I
        flip once so I can get get those nice grill marks.) Cook them until your
        desired doneness (around 125-130ºF for medium rare, around 1 minute per
        side for each inch of thickness). But before you take them off the
        grill.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        Add the dry ingredients in a few batches, folding gently. Scrape down
        the sides of the bowl as you go to keep everything incorporating evenly.
        Use a light touch — overworking the flour makes for tough results.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        add your cheese and toast your buns. Let the cheese melt while the
        burgers are still on the grill; to speed things up, you can close the
        cover.
      </li>
      <li class="links1">
        Once your burgers iare finished cooking, and your cheese is melty and
        your buns are nicely charred, throw some condiments and toppings on
        those burgers. Anything goes. (Really, anything goes.) Bite into it and
        let those juices run down your chin, and rejoice that it's summer. And
        then make another round, because now you know how.
      </li>
